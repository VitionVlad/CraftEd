While working on various projects, I encountered a small problem: creating maps manually is quite a hard and tedious task. Using other editors for this might not be convenient due to format compatibility. My engine may have light sources, audio, and models in a scene, so I decided to write my own map editor. It can actually be used for all types of graphic design, even allowing you to "play" the map. The only requirement is having the necessary resources and an SDF file.

The editor has a quite simple UI, so I don't think anyone will encounter any problems understanding how it works. A small exception might be the asset panel, where you create materials. Here, you select a texture from the dropdown menu and then click the button that corresponds to the texture's function. For example, to create a normal map, select the normal texture and click the "Normal" button. After completing these steps, hit "Create," and the material will be created.  
Additionally, the UI can be turned off like this:

The UI can be toggled on and off using the "O" key, or each panel can be toggled on and off using the keys from "R" to "I".  
The editor is available both as a website and a downloadable app.
